# CopySource

CopySource is a Chrome Extension that lets you copy whatever you copy plus the link page of the page you copied it from. 

I like to take notes of interesting things I find on the internet. Usually, I would copy the text and then come back for the link. Too much back and forth!

With CopySource, you can hit Ctrl/CMD + (C and X at the same time).

Example:

> This year, I spent a lot of time doubting myself and not knowing what to do, but looking back, it was one of the best years of my life.

With the extension, you would automatically get the source:

> This year, I spent a lot of time doubting myself and not knowing what to do, but looking back, it was one of the best years of my life.
>
> Source: https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/annual-review-2022

That's it. I hope you find it as useful as I did.
